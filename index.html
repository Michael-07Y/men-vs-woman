                    <p>As time goes on, by the visual of the differences in GPA in college and high school, females have been the leading average for higher GPA.  By the visualization, the peak of high school GPA was around 2010 and the lowest drop was around 2020. Also the college graph shows how the Covid pandemic made a massive change to GPA in college by different genders. </p>

                    <h3>Survey Responses</h3>
                    <p>The survey results depicted in the education graph indicate clear trends in perceptions of educational outcomes based on gender. Respondents believe that males are more likely to graduate with an advanced diploma, as evidenced by the higher likelihood scores toward the male end of the scale. Standard classes show a relatively even distribution, suggesting that both genders are equally perceived as likely to take standard classes. Advanced classes like AP or honors are perceived to be more frequently pursued by males, with a noticeable increase in likelihood scores towards the male end.</p>

This graph shows how the probability changes overtime for both genders and displays them by there assigned color. the number is represented as a decimal that is then converted to a percentage meaning 0.1 is 10%.</p>

                        <h1>Age Difference</h1>
                        <p>During childhood, boys and girls often exhibit different physical development patterns, with boys typically growing more muscle mass and girls maturing faster in terms of puberty. Mentally, boys may demonstrate more impulsive behaviors and risk-taking, while girls often develop stronger verbal skills and emotional regulation earlier. Socially, girls tend to form closer, more communicative relationships, while boys may engage more in group activities and competitive play. As they transition into adulthood, these differences can become more pronounced: men often emphasize independence and achievement, whereas women may prioritize relationships and community.</p>
