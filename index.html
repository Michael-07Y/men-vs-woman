                        <h1>Age Difference</h1>
                        <p>During childhood, boys and girls often exhibit different physical development patterns, with boys typically growing more muscle mass and girls maturing faster in terms of puberty. Mentally, boys may demonstrate more impulsive behaviors and risk-taking, while girls often develop stronger verbal skills and emotional regulation earlier. Socially, girls tend to form closer, more communicative relationships, while boys may engage more in group activities and competitive play. As they transition into adulthood, these differences can become more pronounced: men often emphasize independence and achievement, whereas women may prioritize relationships and community.</p>
