# Project review and my outcome

### What I have learned:

>From this project I have learned multiple skills that being time management, organization, programming, data analysis, and most importantly professionalism.  This project has lead me to feel inspired to continue this work for the summer and future projects.  I have already done a project in this type of format for a interactive map which tested my ability to program interactive buttons and overall an enjoyable experience for learning.
>
> Not only have I learned all these skills, but overall the ability to find a topic I enjoy in a creative aspect.  This idea was not planned nor brought up by someone else.  I found interest in this topic for its unique oppertunities and the complexity it has with it.  This topic can be difficult for some to discuss, but I feel I have achieved a successful result in data from this project.

### What I would do differently

> For most people they will look at this and think "What problems could this project possibly have? Its amazing!". In my eyes there are many things that I would have done differently that being the overall structure of the website and documentation. Due to the mass amounts of time needed for this project, I only got done what was possible.  This project and topic can have so much more that would take months of effort.  This project was basically done by a group of 2 people.  One of them being the main programmer and designer of the project. 
>
> This does not give any excuse to further individual projects, but honestly inspires me to work faster, harder and with a better mindset of whats to come.  This project would be completely different if I had atleast another month and a better team of people, but I still feel like I achieved whats needed for such an amazing topic.
